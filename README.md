# üèçÔ∏è FastDAG2PAG-python

**FastDAG2PAG-python** is a Python tool for converting **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** into **Partial Ancestral Graphs (PAGs)**.  
It is inspired by the `dag2pag` function from the R package [pcalg](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcalg/index.html) üß†, reimplemented in Python for improved accessibility and integration into modern workflows.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- The skeleton learning implemented in this tool **does not** account for selection bias (I will address this in future updates), following the same theoretical foundation as the `dag2pag` in the R package **pcalg**.  
  - Reference: Richardson, T. S., & Spirtes, P. (2002). Ancestral Graph Markov Models, Theorem 4.2.
- The core logic has been **refactored** and **optimized** for Python.

**Additionally, I have discovered a potential issue in pcalg's dag2pag implementation. For details, please see `compare_pcalg.ipynb` in this repository.**
