# DAG to PAG Python ðŸš€

A Python tool for converting Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) into Partial Ancestral Graphs (PAGs) using the [causal-learn](https://github.com/cmu-phil/causal-learn) package.

## Features of `DAG_to_PAG.py` âœ¨
- ðŸ”„ Converts a DAG adjacency matrix (NumPy array or Pandas DataFrame) into a PAG.
- ðŸ§© Supports specifying latent variables and selection bias nodes.
- âœ… Ensures compatibility with causal-learn's graph representation.

> Note: When the number of nodes is large, dag2pag runs slowly.
